# Predict New Medicines
Use machine learning predict to predict potential new drugs. This is my contribution to the Kaggle competition Leash Bio - Predict New Medicines with BELKA
Predict small molecule-protein interactions using the Big Encoded Library for Chemical Assessment (BELKA). The full training of all the input data requires a lot of computing power. The notebook showcases a training of a small offset of the available data.
This is an example of extremely imbalanced machine learning problem where the number of positive cases are less than a percent of the negative cases in the training set.
